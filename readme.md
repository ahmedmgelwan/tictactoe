##  Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their symbols ('X' or 'O') on the board until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.

3. `check_win(board, current_player)`: Checks if the current player has won the game.
4. `check_tie(board)`: Checks if the game has ended in a tie.
5. `switch_player()`: Alternates the current player between 'X' and 'O' after each move.

### How to Play

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Python script.
3. Players will take turns entering row and column numbers to place their symbols on the board.
4. The game continues until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.
